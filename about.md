This blog charts my experance into becoming a Creative Technologist. It's here I can share my adventures and organise and share some knowhow.

I'm London based and for the past five years, a front end developer with a design background. I've worked with nemourous organisations delivering fast, scalable, accessible and eloquent code. My design past gave me opportunity to work in a wide range of disciplines where I enjoyed the process of discovering, experimenting and iterating to find the best solutions which has continued into my development practice when using new technologies and languages.
