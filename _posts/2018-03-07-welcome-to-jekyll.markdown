I'm writing this on the eve on starting as a creative tech in a London agency. Full of anticipation I've spent time during a week off between ending as a front end developer and starting my new position brushing up on a few things.

During this time I was keen stay efficient and use what time I have proactively so I've started using a "learning methodology". Strip away some of that rhetoric of and think it more as a simple technique designed to engage you with information more proactively than just reading. The result should be a better understanding through interpreting information and so remembering it more clearly in a way suited to you.

Here's an example of the [SQ3R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R) process I've adopted:

**Scan** 

Read only the page structure - i.e. the headings, diagrams and bold text etc.

**Question**

Write a series of questions - make these the things you'd like to know about the topic but make sure you not asking for any detail based on assumption.

**Read**

Sit and read the information without refuring back to your questions notes.

**Recite**

Return back to your questions and answer them in your own words without refuring back to the text.

**Review**

Check your happy â€” this is not about making your notes as well written as the original text but ensuring it has all the points you wish to takeaway. I've found that I nearly always need to add some more information and a few quotes marked in italics.
